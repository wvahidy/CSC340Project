Restaurant Manager Program
authors: Jeffrey, Jeremy, Luke, Warisha

goal: Help a restaurant manager (the user) do their job. Namely, edit reservations and table assignments.
overview:
(1) Present the user with an option menu to manage reservations or tables
(2) The reservation list and table list are based on linked lists data structures
(3) Let the user know if what they did succeeded or failed

Option Menu for the user:
(1) View reservations
(2) View Tables
(3) Add a reservation
(4) Delete a reservation
(5) Sort list by priority
(6) Sort list by time
(7) Assign reservations
(8) Search reservations

Important Notes:
-   When adding a reservation, the user enters the name, time, number of people in the party, and the priority.
    The time is entered in military time and is converted to standard time so that it is easier for the user to read.
    "Priority" means how important the guest is. Such as VIP customers, which will be prioritized in serving.

-   The reservation list is kept on a .txt file. It is updated directly after any changes are made to it
    (add or delete). The .txt file is automatically read into the program when it starts.
